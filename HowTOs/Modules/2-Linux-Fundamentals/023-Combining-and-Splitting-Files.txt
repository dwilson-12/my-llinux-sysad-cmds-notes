* There's a situation when you need to cut the files to become smaller files when compressing is not enough to make the file size small.
* When you need to send the file but the size is too large.

* Multiple files can be combined into one and
* One file can be split into multiple files

$ cat file1 file2 file3 > file4
$ split file4

e.g
$ split -l 300 file.txt childfile

Split file.txt into 300 lines per file and output to childfileaa, childfileab, and childfileac
