* "tee" command is used to store and (both at the same time) output of any command.

* The command is named after the T-splitter used in plumbing.
  It basically breaks the output of a program so that it can be both displayed and saved in a file.
  It does both the task simultaneously, copies the result into the specified files or variables and also display the result.

Example:

$ tee --help

# display the output on the screen and saved's the file.
$ echo "some text" | tee filename

# appends a text to a file
$ echo "add some text" | tee -a filename filename2 filname3
