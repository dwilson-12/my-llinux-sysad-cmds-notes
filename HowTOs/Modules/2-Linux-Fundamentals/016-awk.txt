$ ls -l | awk '{print $1,$3}'			 = List 1st and 3rd field of ls -l output.
$ ls -l | awk '{print $NF}'			 = Last field of the output.
$ awk '/Jerry/ {print}' [filename]		 = Search for a specific word.
$ awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd		 = Output only 1st field of /etc/passwd.
$ echo "Hello Tom" | awk '{$2="Adam"; print $0}' = Replace words field words.
$ cat file | awk '{$2="Imran"; print $0}'	 = Replace words field words.
$ awk 'length($0) > 15' [filename]		 = get lines that have more than 15 byte size.
$ ls -l | awk '{if($9 == "seinfeld") print $0;}' = Get the field matching seinfeld in /home/username.
$ ls -l | awk '{print NF}'			 = Number of fields.
