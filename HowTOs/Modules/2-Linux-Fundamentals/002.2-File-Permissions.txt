* UNIX is a multi-user system. Every file and directory in your account can be protected from or made accessible
     to other users by changing its access permissions. Every user has a responsibility for controlling access
     to their files.

* Permission for a file or directory may be restricted to by types:

There are 3 types of permissions
	1. r - read
	2. w - write
	3. x - execute = running a program

Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at three levels:
	* u - user  = yourself
	* g - group = can be people in the same proj.
	* o - other = everyone on the system
	* a - all

File or Directory permission can be display by running ls -l command
	$ -rwxrwxrwx

Command to change permission
	$ chmod

Example:

# removed write permission of the group
$ chmod g-w jerry

# removed write permission of a user
$ chmod u-w jerry

#Add permission
$ chmod u+w jerry
