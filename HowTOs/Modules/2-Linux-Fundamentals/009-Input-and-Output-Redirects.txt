* There are 3 redirects in linux
	1. Standard input (stdin) and it has file descriptor num as 0
	2. Standard output (stdout) and it has file descriptor num as 1
	3. Standard error (stderr) and it has file descriptor num as 2

* Output (stdout) - 1
	* By default when running a command its output goes to terminal
	* The output of a command can be routed to a file using > symbol
		* E.g.	$ ls -l > listings
			$ pwd > findpath
	* If using the same file for additional output or to append to the same file then use >>
		* E.g.	$ ls -la >> listings
			$ echo "hello world" >> findpath

* Input (stdin) - 0
	* Input is used when feeding file contents to a file
		* E.g	$ cat < listings
		     	$ mail -s "Office memo" allusers@abc.com < memoletter
				
* Error (stderr) - 2
	* When a command is executed we use a keyboard and that is also considered (stdin - 0)
	* That command output goes on the monitor and that output is (stdout - 1)
	* If the command produced any error on the screen then it is considered (stderr - 2)
		* We can use redirects to route errors from the screen
			* E.g.	$ ls -l /root 2> errorfile
				$ telnet localhost 2> errorfile
