• kill command is used to terminate processes manually
• It sends a signal which ultimately terminates or kills a particular process or group of processes

Usage:
$ kill [OPTION] [PID]

OPTION	= Signal name or signal number/ID
PID	= Process ID

kill -l	= to get a list of all signal names or signal number

* Most used signals are:
$ kill PID	= Kill a process with default signal
$ kill -1	= Restart
$ kill -2 	= Interrupt from the keyboard just like Ctrl C
$ kill -9	= Forcefully kill the process
$ kill -15	= Kill a process gracefully

* Other similar kill commands are:
$ killall	= kill a process and it's related process
$ pkill		= kill by the process name
