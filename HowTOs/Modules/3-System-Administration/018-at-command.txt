* at command is like crontab which allows you to schedule jobs but only once
* When the command is run it will enter interactive mode and you can get out by pressing Ctrl D

Usage:
at HH:MM PM		= Schedule a job
atq			= List the at entries
atrm #			= Remove at entry
atd			= at daemon/service that manages scheduling
systemctl status atd	= To manage the atd service

* Create at entry by scheduling a task:
	$ at 4:45PM â†’ (hit enter)
	at> echo "This is my first at entry" > at-entry (hit Crtl D)

Other future scheduling format:

$ at 2:45 AM 101621	 = Schedule a job to run on Oct 16th, 2021 at 2:45am
$ at 4PM + 4 days	 = Schedule a job at 4pm four days from now
$ at now +5 hours	 = Schedule a job to run five hours from now
$ at 8:00 AM Sun	 = Schedule a job to 8am on coming Sunday
$ at 10:00 AM next month = Schedule a job to 10am next month
