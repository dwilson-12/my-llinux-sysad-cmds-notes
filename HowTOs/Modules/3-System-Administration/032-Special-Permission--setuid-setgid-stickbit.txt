There are 3 additional permissions in Linux

* setuid: bit tells Linux to run a program with the effective user id of the owner instead of the executor: 
  (e.g. passwd command) â†’ /etc/shadow

* setgid: bit tells Linux to run a program with the effective group id of the owner instead of the executor: 
  (e.g. locate or wall command)

Please note: This bit is present for only files which have executable permissions
sticky bit: a bit set on files/directories that allows only the owner or root to delete those files


* To assign special permissions at the user level
	$ chmod u+s xyz.sh

* To assign special permissions at the group level
	$ chmod g+s xyz.sh

* To remove special permissions at the user or group level
	$ chmod u-s xyz.sh
	$ chmod g-s xyz.sh

Please note:
These bits work on c programming executables not on bash shell scripts

* To find all executables in Linux with setuid and setgid permissions
	$ find -perm /6000 -type f

Sticky bit

* It is assigned to the last bit of permissions
	-rwx rwx rwt

Why?	Example of /tmp directory
