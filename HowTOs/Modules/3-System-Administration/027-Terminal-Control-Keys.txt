* Several key combinations on your keyboard usually have a special effect on the terminal.

* These "control" (CTRL) keys are accomplished by holding the CTRL key while typing the second key.
For example, CTRL-c means to hold the CTRL key while you type the letter "c".

* The most common control keys are listed below:

CTRL+u	= erase everthing you've typed on the command line
CTRL+c 	= stop/kill a command
CTRL+z	= suspend a command
CTRL+d	= exit from an interactive program (signals end of data)
