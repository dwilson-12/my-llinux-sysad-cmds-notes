• What is a Shell Script?
    Ans: A shell script is an executable file containing multiple shell commands that are executed sequentially. The file can contain:

* Shell (#!/bin/bash)
* Comments (# comments)
* Commands (echo, cp, grep etc.)
* Statements (if, while, for etc.)

• Shell script should have executable permissions (e.g. -rwx r-x r-x)
• Shell script has to be called from absolute path (e.g /home/userdir/script.bash)
• If called from current location then ./script.bash
