* SATA Stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment and SAS stands for Serial Attached SCSI 
  (SCSI Stands for Small Computer System Interface, typically pronounced as "scuzzy").

* Both SAS and SATA utilize serial communication. Serial communication means that the highway has both lanes

* The main difference between them is that SAS drives are faster and more reliable than SATA drives
  SAS is generally more expensive, and it's better suited for use in servers or in processing-heavy computer workstations. 
  SATA is less expensive, and it's better suited for desktop file storage.
  In a SATA cable, all 4 wires are placed within the same cable. 
  In a SAS cable, the 4 wires are separated into 2 different cables.

Why divide the wires between 2 cables???
* So you can connect more devices to one another. With a SATA cable, you can only link the motherboard
  and the storage drive. You could hook up an expansion device, but that takes up valuable room inside your computer.
* With a SAS cable, you can hook up the motherboard to both a storage drive and another piece of hardware that has SAS connectors.

Here's what the highways look like, metaphorically:
* SATA cable: Los Angeles to San Francisco
* SAS cable: Los Angeles to San Francisco or Los Angeles to Las Vegas
