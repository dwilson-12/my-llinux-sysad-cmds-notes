• Linux fsck utility is used to check and repair Linux filesystems (ext2, ext3, ext4, etc.)

• Linux xfs_repair utility is used to check and repair Linux filesystems for xfs filesystem type

• Depending on when was the last time a file system was checked, 
  the system runs the fsck during boot time to check whether the filesystem is in consistent state.

• System administrator could also run it manually when there is a problem with the filesystems

• Make sure to execute the fsck on an unmounted file systems to avoid any data corruption issues.
  The / directory cannot be unmount.

• Force a filesystem check even if it's clean using option -f

• Attempt to fix detected problems automatically using option -y

• The xfs_repair utility is highly scalable and is designed to repair even very large file systems with many inodes efficiently. 
  Unlike other Linux file systems, xfs_repair does not run at boot time
  
• The following are the possible exit codes for fsck command:

o	- No errors
1	- Filesystem errors corrected
2 	- System should be rebooted
4 	- Filesystem errors left uncorrected
8 	- Operational error
16 	- Usage or syntax error
32 	- Fsck canceled by user request
128 	- Shared-library error


Example:

# repair file system
$ umount /data
$ xfs_repair /dev/sdb1

# Check the exit code
$ echo $?

# mount it again
$ mount /dev/sdb1 /data
