* NFS stands for Network File System, a file system developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
* It is a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network 
  and treat them as if they resided in a local file directory.
* For example, if you were using a computer linked to a second computer via NFS, 
  you could access files on the second computer as if they resided in a directory on the first computer. 
  This is accomplished through the processes of exporting (the process by which an NFS server provides remote 
  clients with access to its files) and mounting (the process by which client map NFS shared filesystem).
* NFS conf. files = /etc/sysconfig/nfs
		    /etc/exports

Steps for NFS Server Configuration

# Install NFS packages
	$ yum install nfs-utils libnfsidmap (most likely they are installed) 
# Once the packages are installed, enable and start NFS services
	$ systemctl enable rpcbind
	$ systemctl enable nfs-server
	$ systemctl start rpcbind, nfs-server, rpc-statd, nfs-idmapd 
# Create NFS share directory and assign permissions
	$ mkdir /mynfs
	$ chmod a+rwx /mynfs
# Modify /etc/exports file to add new shared filesystem
	/mynfs	192.168.12.7(rw,sync,no_root_squash)	= for only 1 host
	/mynfs	*(rw,sync,no_root_squash)		= for everyone
# Export the NFS filesystem
	$ exportfs -rv

sync =  all changes to the according filesystem are immediately flushed to disk;
        the respective write operations are being waited for

no_root_squash = root on the client machine will have the same level of access to the files
		 on the system as root on the server.

* Steps for NFS Client Configuration

# Install NFS packages
	$ yum install nfs-utils rpcbind
# Once the packages are installed enable and start rpcbind service
	$ systemctl rpcbind start
# Make sure firewalld or iptables stopped (if running)
	$ ps -ef | egrep "firewall|iptable"
# Show mount from the NFS server
	$ showmount -e 192.168.1.x (NFS Server IP)
# Create a mount point
	$ mkdir /mnt/kramer
# Mount the NFS filesystem
	$ mount 192.168.1.5:/mynfs /mnt/kramer
# Verify mounted filesystem
	$ df -h
# To unmount
	$ umount /mnt/kramer

IF NFS SERVICE IS RUNNUNG BEHIND FIREWALL

Uncomment the MOUNTD_PORT, STATD_PORT, LOCKD_TCPPORT, AND LOCKD_UDPPORT in /etc/sysconfig/nfs

Allow TCP and UDP port 2049 for NFS.
Allow TCP and UDP port 111 (rpcbind/sunrpc).
Allow the TCP and UDP port specified with MOUNTD_PORT="port"
Allow the TCP and UDP port specified with STATD_PORT="port"
Allow the TCP port specified with LOCKD_TCPPORT="port"
Allow the UDP port specified with LOCKD_UDPPORT="port"

$ systemctl restart nfs

* To mount the filesystem in boot time add the following below at the end of /etc/fstab
