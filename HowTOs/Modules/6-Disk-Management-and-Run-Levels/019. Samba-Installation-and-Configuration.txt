Samba is a Linux tool or utility that allows sharing for Linux resources
      such as files and printers to with other operating systems.
* It works exactly like NFS but the difference is NFS shares within Linux or Unix like system 
  whereas Samba shares with other OS (e.g. Windows, MAC etc.).
* For example, computer “A” shares its filesystem with computer “B” using Samba then computer "B" 
  will see that shared filesystem as if it is mounted as the local filesystem.

Samba (smb vs. CIFS)

* Samba shares its filesystem through a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block) which was invented by IBM.
* Another protocol used to share Samba is through CIFS (Common Internet File System) invented by Microsoft and NMB (NetBios Named Server).
* CIFS became the extension of SMB and now Microsoft has introduced newer version of SMB v2 and v3 that are mostly used in the industry.

In simple term, most people, when they use either SMB or CIFS, are talking about the same exact thing.

Samba Installation and Configuration: 

• Take snapshot of your VM
• Install samba packages
• Enable samba to be allowed through firewall (Only if you have firewall running)
• Disable firewall
• Create Samba share directory and assign permissions
• Also change the SELinux security context for the samba shared directory
• Or disable SELinux
• Modify /etc/samba/smb.conf file to add new shared filesystem
• Verify the setting
• Once the packages are installed, enable and start Samba services (smb and nmb)
• Mount Samba share on Windows client
• Mount Samba share on Linux client
• Additional instructions on creating secure Samba share

I encounter some error package when I run "yum install samba samba-common samba-client" (repo is out sync)

Solution:
# yum clean all
# yum distro-sync
