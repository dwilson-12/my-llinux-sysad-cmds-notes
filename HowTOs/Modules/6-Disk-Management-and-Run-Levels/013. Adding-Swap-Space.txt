* What is swap? - CentOS.org
  Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. 
  If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. 
  While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. 
  Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory.


Recommended swap size = Twice the size of RAM 
M = Amount of RAM in GB, and S = Amount of swap in GB, then

If M < 2
then S = M * 2
Else S = M + 2

# 1GB of virtual memory or swap is automatically created. If your memory is 1GB you will only add 1GB to make it 2GB
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/newswap bs=1M count=1024
if = read from file
of = write to a file/virtual pages
bs = byte size
count = total size of the file
