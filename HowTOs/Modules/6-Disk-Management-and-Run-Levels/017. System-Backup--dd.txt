SYSTEM BACKUP (dd Command)

5 Different Types of Backups

1. System backup (entire image using tools such as acronis, Veeam, Commvault etc.)
2. Application backup (3rd party application backup solution)
3. Database backup (Oracle dataguard, SQL backup etc.)
4. Filesystem backup (tar, gzip directoris etc.)
5. Disk backup or disk cloning (dd command)


* dd is a command-line utility for Unix and Unix-like operating systems
  whose primary purpose is to convert and copy files.

* As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot sector of a hard drive,
  and obtaining a fixed amount of random data.

* Please note the source and destination disk should be the same size.

To backup or clone an entire hard disk to another hard disk connected to the same system, 
execute the dd command as shown:

$ dd if=<source filename> of=<target filename> [Options]
$ dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb status=progress

# To backup/copy the disk partition
$ dd if=/dev/sdal of=/root/sdal.img

# Restoring this image file to other machine after copying the .img
$  dd if=/root/sdal.img of=/dev/sdb3
