* Redundant Array of Independent Disk (RAID)
* RAID is designed to store the same data in different locations on multiple hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) 
  to preserve data in the event of a drive failure
* RAID are mostly configured in physical disk


Purpose: To have redundancy

Type of RAID

1. RAID0
2. RAID1
3. RAID5

RAID 0 offers no redundancy and instead uses striping, 
i.e., data is split across all the drives. 
This means RAID 0 offers no fault tolerance; if any of the constituent drives fails, the RAID unit fails.

RAID 1 offers redundancy through mirroring, BUT it's slow.
i.e., data is written identically to two drives

RAID 5 the way this raid work is:

1. You need to have 3 or more disk
2. Fast and can be stored large amount of data.
3. The data is not duplicated, but it's striped or spread accross multiple disks.
4. There is another very important piece of information that is being evenly spread accross the disk,
   and that information is parity.
5. Parity is used to rebuild the data in the event of a disk failure
6. If disk were to fail you would not lose any data, because all you have to do is to replace
   the failed disk with a new one and raid 5 used the parity information from the other disk
   to rebuild the data on the new hard drive.
7. However, if 2 disc were fail at the same time, then all the data would be lost.
8. because raid5 can only handle 1 disk failure, so if 2 disk fails the data is loss.
