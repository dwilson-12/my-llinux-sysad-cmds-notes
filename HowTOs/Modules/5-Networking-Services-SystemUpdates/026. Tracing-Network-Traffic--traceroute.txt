* The traceroute command is used in linux to map the journey that a packet of
  information undertakes from it's source to its destination. One use for traceroute
  is to locate when data loss occurs throughout a network, which could signify a node that's down.

* Because each hop in the record reflects a new server or router between the originating PC and
  the intended target, reviewing the results of a traceroute scan also lets you identify slow points
  that may adversely affect your network traffic.

Example:
$ traceroute <URL or IP Address>
