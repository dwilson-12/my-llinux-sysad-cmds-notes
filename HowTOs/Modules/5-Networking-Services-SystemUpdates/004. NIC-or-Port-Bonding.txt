NIC = Network Interface Card

NIC(Network Interface Card) bonding is also known as Network Bonding.
	It can be defined as the aggregation or combination of multiple
	NIC into a single bond interface.

It's main purpose is to provide high availability and redundancy.

NIC Bonding Procedure

1. Install bonding driver	= modprobe bonding

2. modinfo bonding	  	= To check if the driver is installed.

3. Create /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0 file and add this contents.

DEVICE=bond0
TYPE=Bond
NAME=bond0
BONDING_MASTER=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
IPADDR=192.168.1.55
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
BONDING_OPTS="mode=5 miimon=100"

4. edit  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet1

TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=none
DEVICE=enp0s3
ONBOOT=yes
HWADDR=”MAC from the ifconfig command”
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes

5. edit  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet2

TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=none
DEVICE=enp0s8
ONBOOT=yes
HWADDR=”MAC from the ifconfig command”
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes

6. Restart network = systemctl restart network

7. Use following command to view bond interface settings like bonding mode & slave interface.
$ cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
