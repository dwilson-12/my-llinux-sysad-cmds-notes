* Linux system comes fined tunned by default when you install, 
 however there are a few tweaks that can be done based on system performance and application requirements.

Those are:
1. Optimize system performance by selecting a TUNING PROFILE managed by the tuned daemon.
2. Prioritize or de-prioritize specific processes with the NICE and RENICE commands.

What is tuned?

* Tuned pronounced as tune-d
* Tune is for system tuning and d is for daemon
* It is systemd service that is used to tune Linux system performance
* It is installed in CentOS/Redhat version 7 and 8 by default
* tuned package name is tuned
* The tuned service comes with pre-defined profiles and settings
  Based on selected profile the tuned service automictically adjust system to get the best performance.
  E.g. tuned will adjust networking if you are downloading a large file or it  will adjust IO settings if it detects high storage read/write
* The tuned daemon applies system settings when the service starts or upon selection of a new tuning profile.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Check if tuned package has been installed
	$ rpm –qa | grep tuned

* Install tuned package if NOT installed already
	$ yum install tuned

* Check tuned service status
	$ systemctl status|enable|start tuned
	$ systemctl enable tuned (To enable at boot time)

* Command to change setting for tuned daemon
	$ tuned-adm

* To check which profile is active
	$ tuned-adm active 

* To list available profiles
	$ tuned-adm list

* To change to desired profile
	$ tuned-adm profile profile-name

* Check for tuned recommendation
	$ tuned-adm recommend

* Turn off tuned setting daemon
	$ tuned-adm off

* Another way of keeping your system fine-tuned is by prioritizing processes through nice and renice command
* If a server has 1 CPU then it can execute 1 computation/process at a time as they come in (first come first served) while other processes must wait
* With nice and renice commands we can make the system to give preference to certain processes than others
* This priority can be set at 40 different levels
* The nice level values range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority) and by default, 
  processes inherit their nice level from their parent, which is usually 0.


* To set the process priority 
	$ nice –n # process-name
	e.g. 
	$ nice –n -15 top


* To change the process priority 
	$ renice –n # process-name
	e.g. $ renice –n 12 PID.
