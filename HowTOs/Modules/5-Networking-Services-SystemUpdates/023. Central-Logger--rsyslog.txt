Acts as a server to received logs from other servers

* Purpose	= Generate logs or collect logs from other servers
* package name	= rsyslog
* Conf. file	= /etc/rsyslog.conf
* Service	= $ systemctl restart rsyslog
		= $ systemctl enable rsyslog

Configuring rsyslog Server
---------------------------------------------------
1. rsyslog is by default installed on most of the Linux distros including RHEL/CentOS.
Connect to rsyslog server and check status of rsyslog.service, start it if it is not running. (Install the package from repository if there is no such service present)
	$ rpm -qi rsyslog
	$ systemctl start rsyslog.service
	$ systemctl enable rsyslog.service
	$ systemctl status rsyslog.service

2. Now we are configuring rsyslog settings to accept input from other machines.
	$ vim /etc/rsyslog.conf

	# Find and uncomment following two directives.
	$ModLoad imtcp
	$InputTCPServerRun 514

Save settings.

3. Now restart the rsyslog.service.
	$ systemctl restart rsyslog.service

4. Allow rsyslog service port in Linux firewall and reload the firewall.
	$ firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/tcp
	$ firewall-cmd --reload


Configuring rsyslog Client
---------------------------------------------------
1. Connect to rsyslogclient.nehraclasses and check status of rsyslog.service, start & enable it if not running.
	$ rpm -qi rsyslog
	$ systemctl start rsyslog.service
	$ systemctl enable rsyslog.service
	$ systemctl start rsyslog.service

2. Now configure rsyslog client to transmit its log to our rsyslog server by adding the following directives in /etc/rsyslog.conf
	$ vim /etc/rsyslog.conf
	# *.* @@192.168.1.x:514

3. Restart the rsyslog.service to apply changes.
	$ systemctl restart rsyslog.service

Our rsyslog client has been configured.
=========================================

Now connect to our rsyslog server and check /var/log/messages
	# tail /var/log/messages
