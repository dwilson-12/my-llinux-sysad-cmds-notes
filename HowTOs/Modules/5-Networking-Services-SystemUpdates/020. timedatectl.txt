* New utility for RHEL/CentOS 7/8, which comes as a part of systemd system and servive manager.
* Repalcement for old traditional "date" command.
* timedatectl shows/change date, time, and timezone.
* It synchronizes the time with NTP server as well
	* You can either use chronyd or ntpd and make the ntp setting in timedatectl as yes.
	* Or you can use systemd-timesyncd daemon to sync time which is a replacement for
	  ntpd and chronyd

Pleae note: Redhat/CentOS does not provide this daemon in its standard repo.
	    You will have to download it separately.

Lab exercise:

# To check time status
	$ timedatectl

# To view all available time zones
	$ timedatectl list-timezones

# To set the time zone
	$ timedatectl set-timezone "America/New_York"

# To set date
	$ timedatectl set-time YYYY-MM-DD

# To set date and time
	$ timedatectl set-time '2015-11-20 16:14:50'

# To start automatic time synchronization with a remote NTP server
	$ timedatectl set-tnp true
