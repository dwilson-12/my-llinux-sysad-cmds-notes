* Following are the most common configuration an administrator should take to secure SSH.

1. Configure Idle Timeout Interval
   Avoid having an unattended SSH session.

	* Become root
	* Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add the ff. line.
	* ClientAliveInterval 600
	* ClientAliveCountMax 0
	* $ systemctl restart sshd

*  The idle timeout interval you are setting is in sec. (600 secs = 10 mins.).
   Once the interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out.

2. Disable root login
   Disabling root login should be one of the measures you should take when setting
   up the system for the first time. It disable any user to login to the system
   with root account.

	* Become root
	* Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and replace PermitRootLogin yes to no
	* PermitRootLogin no
	* $ systemctl restart sshd

3. Disable Emtpy Passwords
   You need to prevent remote logins from accounts with empty passwords for added security

	* Become root
	* Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and remove # from the following line
	* PermitEmptyPasswords no
	* $ systemctl restart sshd

4. Limit User's SSH Access
   To provide another layer's security, you should limit your SSH logins to only certain
   user's  who need remote access

	* Become root
	* Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add
	* AllowUsers user1 user2
	* $ systemctl restart sshd

5. Use a different port
   By default SSH port run on 22. Most hackers looking for any open SSH servers will look
   for port 22 and changing can make the system much more secure.
	
	* Become root
	* setenforce 0
	* Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and remove # from the ff. line and change the port number
	* port 22
	* $ systemctl restart sshd

6. SSH-Keys - Access Remote Server w/o Password
