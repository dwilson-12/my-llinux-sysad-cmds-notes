* The SCP helps to transfer computer files securely from a local to a remote host.
  It is somewhat similar to the FTP, but it adds security and authentication.

* Default SCP port = 22 (same as SSH)

client ==> Server 	# client wants to copy a file over to server

Usage:

# Copy file from local host to a remote host SCP example
$ scp filename username@to_host:/remote/directory

# From remote host to the local host /dir
$ scp username@remotehost:filename /local/directory
