* DNS is a system that translates a hostname to IP address.
	  Package to installed is called "bind"

Purpose?
	Hostname to IP		(A Record)
	IP to hostname		(PTR Record)
	Hostname to Hostname	(CNAME Record)

Files
	named			= named of the process of the DNS
	/etc/named.conf		= Configuration file
	/var/named		= dir, all zone files where you define all the hostname to IP, IP to hostname

Service
	$ systemctl restart named

			Download, Install, and Configure DNS

* Create a snapshot of your virtual machine
* Setup
    * Master DNS
    * Secondary or Slave DNS
    * Client

* Domain Name	= lab.local
* IP address	= My local IP address on enp0s3


* Install DNS package
	* $ yum install bind bind-utils -y

* Configure DNS (summary)
	* Modify /etc/named.conf
	* Create two zone files (forward.lab and reverse.lab)
	* Modify DNS file permission and start the service

* Revert back to snapshot

Steps:

* Install DNS package
	# yum install bind bind-utils –y

* Configure DNS Server
	# vi /etc/named.conf

* Edit the line
listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
with
listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.29; };

allow-query { localhost; }
with
allow-query { localhost;any; }

* Start the service named
	# systemctl start named
	# systemctl enable named

* Allow port 53

	# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/tcp
	# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/udp
	# firewall-cmd --reload
	# firewall-cmd --list-all

* Create zones in /etc/named.conf
  Go to the bottom of the file before “include” line and add

zone "lab.local" IN {
	type master;
	file "forward.lab";
	allow-update { none; };
};
zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
	type master;
	file "reverse.lab";
	allow-update { none; };
};

include "/etc/named.rfc1912.zones";
include "/etc/named.root.key";

* Create zone files in /var/named/	foward.lab and reverse.lab
  copy the named.localhost file and edit it

forward.lab
$TTL 1D
@	IN	SOA	masterdns.lab.local.	root.lab.local. (
						0	; serial
						1D	; refresh
						1H	; retry
						1W	; expire
						3H )	; minimum

@	IN	NS	masterdns.lab.local.
@	IN	A	<masterdns IP>
masterdns	IN	A	masterdns IP>
client	IN	A	<IP Addr>
client	IN	A	<IP Addr>
client	IN	A	<IP Addr>

reverse.lab
$TTL 1D
@	IN	SOA	masterdns.lab.local.	root.lab.local. (
						0	; serial
						1D	; refresh
						1H	; retry
						1W	; expire
						3H )	; minimum

@	IN	NS	masterdns.lab.local.
@	IN	PTR	lab.local.
<last octect of IP>	IN	PTR	<DOMAIN NAME>
29	IN	PTR	masterdns.lab.local.
27	IN	PTR	client.lab.local.

* Change the group ownership of those files to named

	# chgrp named forward.lab
	# chgrp named reverse.lab

* Check if the configuration is all correct

	# named-checkconf -z /etc/named.conf

* Check if the zone files are correct

	# named-checkzone forward /var/named/forward.lab
	# named-checkzone reverse /var/named/reverse.lab

* restart the service

	# systemctl restart named

CLIENT SIDE

* edit the /etc/resolve.conf and add the IP of the nameserver

search <domain name>
serach lab.local

nameserver <master DNS IP ADDR>
nameserver 192.168.1.29
