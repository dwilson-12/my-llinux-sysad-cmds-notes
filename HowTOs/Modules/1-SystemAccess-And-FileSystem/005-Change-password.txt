* You should change your initial password as soon as you login

* User change password

Remember: If your login as root, the command passwd only will change the password of your root.
	  And the command passwd followed by user id will change the password of that user

# The command
$ passwd [userid] # Only root can specify a user name

old pass:

new pass:

retype new pass:
